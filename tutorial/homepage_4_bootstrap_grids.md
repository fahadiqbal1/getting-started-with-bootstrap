# Learning out Bootstrap Grids

So far, everything that we have built has been linear; meaning all of the components and lines come one after the other, there is nothing side-by-side.

One of the major benefits of Bootstrap is the ability to use a comprehensive grid system that takes into account the screen size. So imagine on your laptop, you want to show 3 paragraphs side-by-side. That would look fine on the laptop but it would be smashed together on phone or tablet screen.
