# Designing the About Page

Like the Home Page, before we get to coding, we should design the page on paper, so we can visualize exactly what it is that we will be building.

In this tutorial, our about page will be pretty minimal, but when you get to building your own page, you should try and make it your own as best you can. 

In general, an about page should contain the following:

* A picture
* A summary of who you are
* What you like to do / What you can do really well
* What you want to do in the future

None of those are required, per se, but are recommended for a good page.
