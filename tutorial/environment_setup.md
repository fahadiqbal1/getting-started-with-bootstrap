# Environment Setup

1. On your computer's desktop, create a new folder called **Portfolio**
2. Inside of this folder, create the following sub-folders:
  3. **css**
  4. **js**
  5. **pages**
6. In the Portfolio folder, create a new file called ```index.html``` and a file called ```template.html```. The index file will serve as our home page and the template file will be our template.
7. In the css folder, create a new file called ```portfolio.css``` This file will be our custom style sheet.
8. In the js folder, create a new file called ```portfolio.js``` This is where our custom JavaScript will go.
9. You can leave the pages folder empty for now.

Your Portfolio folder should be looking like this:
```
portfolio/
├── index.html
├── portfolio.html
├── css/
│   ├── portfolio.css
├── js/
│   ├── portfolio.js
├── pages/
│   ├── (empty)
```
