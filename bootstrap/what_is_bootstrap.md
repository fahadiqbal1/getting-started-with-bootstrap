# What is Bootstrap?

At it's core, Bootstrap is a front-end web development framework. It basically is a layer on top of HTML to make pages look better. Think of HTML as the cake, and Bootstrap as the icing on top.

## History

Bootstrap was originally built by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter in 2011 in a "Hack Week". Today it is a separate open-source project with hundreds of contributors. The current stable version is 3.3, with version 4 right around the corner.

## Why use Bootstrap?

* **Mobile First**: Bootstrap is designed with mobile in hand. When creating websites, we can just create a single site that will work on all different sized screens.
* **Browser Support**: Right out of the box, Bootstrap allows us to support all different types of browsers. Mobile, Desktop, Tablet, and everything in between!
* **Easy to get started**: By the end of this tutorial, you will be an expert, just you wait and see!
* **Huge community**: If you ever get lost within Bootstrap, there is a large community of people always willing to help.
