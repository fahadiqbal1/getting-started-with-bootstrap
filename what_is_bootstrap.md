# What is Bootstrap

At it's core, Bootstrap is a front-end web development framework. If that all sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, then this is the book for you! Let's break down that first sentence a bit more:

## Bootstrap vs HTML

When you visit a website, there is a lot happening behind the scenes before the page you loaded shows up.

1. Your browser, such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc, makes a call to a domain (e.g. www.google.com)
2. The server behind that domain finds the page's HTML contents and sends it back to the browser.
3. The browser then displays that HTML.
